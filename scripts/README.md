# Scripts

Ancillary scripts.

* `extract2csv.sh`: convert an output file to csv to plot the data. Usage:

  ```bash
  (path to script)/extract2csv.sh outputfile > outputfile.csv
  ```

  You can then use the csv file to plot the outputs. You may have to preface the script with `bash` if it is not executing as is for you.
