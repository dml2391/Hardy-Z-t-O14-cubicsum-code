# Sample input files

Three sample input files: 

1) **input2.nml** is for the `zeta14cubic.f90` code.
2) **input15.nml** is the `zeta15quartic.f90` code.
3) **input3.nml** is for the `zeta14cubicmult.f90` code.
4) **input4.nml** is for the `zeta14cubicmultharness.f90` code.

Files 1) and 2) are basically identical,  files 3) and 4) each contain the extra `numbercalc` parameter for the multi-value code. All very straightforward. The only thing is to make sure to input your data in exactly the same format as shown in these sample files (precisely the same for the t value).
