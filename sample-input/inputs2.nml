! input parameters:
! t > 10**5
! et, the relative error scale 0<et<<1. The smaller et the more accurate your result but
!     the slower the code. A larger value gives a less accurate estimate of Z(t) but 
!     goes faster. Values around 0.01-0.05 worked to six significant figures for 
!     the mc=2 case.
! YT  must have the same value as t but must be expressed as a character string of exactly 
!     length 45 (very important that it is 45).

YT = '3.1067883362908396566754057659368205000000e32'
!YT = '4.5890014847929271884961558864628190000000e31' Make sure YT is written exactly like this. Pad out with zeros to fill decimal places
